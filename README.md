# Academic Performance Prediction
My finals project for CPT15-Specialized Technology 2, a Machine Learning for academic habits.
My groupmate and I got a data set named "Student Habits vs Academic Performance" from kaggle to use in our Machine Learning

We used Linear Reggresion for the main Model and used Random Forest for selecting which features affected the Target Data the most.
